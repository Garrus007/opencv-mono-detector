# opencv-mono-detector
Simple object detection (by color) using mono-camera and reprojection into the 3D ray

Features:
 - Dectect object with specific color (HSV)
 - Reproject object position to the 3D ray (calibrated camera needed)
 - Estimate object position in 3D when object size is known
 - Works with and without ROS
 - Helper launch file to simplify calibration
